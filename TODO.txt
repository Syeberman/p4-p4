
- Ensure both clients have the "unix" LineEndings setting

- Migrate client names for submitted changes (currently all set to one client)

- How does client/server timezone affect the time that's stored in Perforce?

- Keep track of hashes of file revisions, and do "p4 copy" from those files as appropriate
-- Helps to correct files that should have been marked copy
-- Also helps Perforce do lazy copies
-- After "p4 copy", update the hash2depot to the _new_ location, so future copies use latest
    revision (makes history a little more sane)

- While people working in two depots, will need a strategy to keep dest repo up-to-date
-- either pull in to a different branch (//.repo0): resurrect --branch and --keep-path
-- or merge safely, and overwrite conflicts (at least old change is still there) and flag

- Pull in any open branchspec that matches one of the imported paths
-- ...but strip out any paths not imported
-- I've removed --detect-branches


- Pull in labels....maybe?

- Pull in jobs...maybe?
