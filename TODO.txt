-- either pull in to a different branch (//.old-depot): resurrect --branch and --keep-path
-- or merge safely, and overwrite conflicts (at least old change is still there) and flag



- Pull in any open branchspec that matches one of the imported paths
-- ...but strip out any paths not imported
-- I've removed --detect-branches


- Pull in labels....maybe?
